For this challenge, I decided to attempt to add waves of enemies and an enemy that shoots a homing missile at you

I wasn't able to finish the second objective in time but I was able to add waves of enemies.

The first wave spawns 3 enemies, the second spawns 5, and the third spawns 8. After the third wave, the game resets.

I also added some text in the top that tells you what wave you're on and how many enemies are left in the wave.

Unfortunately because I took a while to read the code and figure it out, I wasn't able to implement different proportions of enemies per wave.
With enough time I could definitely do it.

Parts of it may have bugs, which I would need to work out :)
